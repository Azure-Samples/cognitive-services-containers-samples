# Container support for Azure Cognitive Services

[Container support](http://aka.ms/cognitive-services-containers) in [Azure Cognitive Services](http://aka.ms/cognitive-services) allows developers to use the same rich APIs that are available in Azure, but with the flexibility that comes with [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/what-container). Container support is currently available in preview for a subset of [Azure Cognitive Services](http://aka.ms/cognitive-services), including parts of [Computer Vision](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848310&clcid=0x409), [Face](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848324&clcid=0x409), and [Text Analytics](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=848375&clcid=0x409).

This repository contains a set of samples illustrating how to interact with and configure the cognitive services containers.

For the latest information about which containers are available and how to set them up, please see [Container support in Azure Cognitive Services](http://aka.ms/cognitive-services-containers)

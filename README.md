# Container support for Azure Cognitive Services

Container support in [Azure Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/) allows developers to use the same rich APIs that are available in Azure, but with the flexibility that comes with [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/what-container). Container support is currently available in preview for a subset of Azure Cognitive Services, including parts of [Computer Vision](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/home), [Face](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview), and [Text Analytics](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/overview).

For the latest information about which containers are available and how to set them up, please see [Container support in Azure Cognitive Services](http://aka.ms/cognitive-services-containers)

## Samples

This repository contains a set of samples illustrating how to interact with and configure the cognitive services containers.
